=================

This project is designed to check if Stroop effect is statistically significant based on our hypothesis and data set.

----------

>**Background Information**
In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participant’s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed.

----------

>**Variables**

 - **Independent Variable** : 
 Congruent or Incongruent
 - **Dependent Variable**:
 The time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists

----------
>**Hypothesis**

 - mean of reaction time of ***congruent*** condition :  **M1**
 - mean of reaction time of ***incongruent*** condition :  **M2**
 - **Null hypothesis (H0) : H0: M1 >= M2**
*whether the word is in congruent or incrongruent condition, the average time needed to answer the question do not statistically differ from eachother at an alpha of 0.05. Or the congruent words will cost more time than the incongruent word in average  at an alpha of 0.05. Let mu1 denotes the average time needed for the first condition, and mu2 denotes the average time needed for the second condition.*
			
			
 - **Alternative Hypothesis (H1) : H1: M1 < M2**
*the Incongruent words may cost more time than the congruent word in average at an alpha of 0.05. Let mu1 denotes the average time needed for the first condition, and mu2 denotes the average time needed for the second condition.*		

 -  **Statistical Test: **
  Dependent Samples T-test
  
	> **Reason**
 1. Sample Size:
			If the sample size is 30, then it will be more reasonable to use the z-test, since the distribution will be more like a normal distribution.

 2.  Only one sample been tested twice.

----------
>**T-test**

 - One-tailed T-test
 - Alpha (P-value): 0.05
 - Degree of Freedom: 23
 - Critical T-Statistic: (+-)2.069
 - T-statistic: -8.0207069 
 - Confidence Intervel: (-10.02, -5.91)


----------


> **Conclusion**
The T-statistic is clearly less than the Critical T-Statistic, hence the difference is considered to be statistically significant, which means we should reject the null hypothesis.	


----------


> **Reflection**
> Personally, I think the Stroop Effect is due to our brain finds it difficult to ignore the distractions. In the present of both color and word, maybe it's easier for our brain to process the word than the color, that is, our brain has a priority for processing word than color.
